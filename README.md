# 🏠 Apartment Listing Task (Uhomes.ai Inspired)

This mini-project is inspired by **uhomes.ai**, a rental platform for international students.

## 🎯 Objective

Build a simple Vue 3 app that displays a list of apartment cards with mock data.

## 📋 Requirements

- Each card should display:
  - Title (e.g., "Cozy Studio near Tokyo Station")
  - Price (e.g., ¥120,000/month)
  - City (e.g., Tokyo)
  - Type (e.g., 1LDK, Studio, 2B1B)
  - Image (use placeholder or real URLs)

- Cards should be laid out responsively
- Data should come from a static array or JSON in the code

## ✨ Optional Bonus

- Click to expand or show modal with details
- Add sorting by price (high to low)
- Mobile responsiveness: 1 column; Desktop: 2–3 columns

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- Optional: TailwindCSS / Bootstrap / custom styles
- No backend required

## 🕐 Time Limit

Try to complete this within **30–45 minutes**.
